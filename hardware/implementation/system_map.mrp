Peak Memory Usage:  821 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  17 mins 30 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   14 mins 9 secs 

INFO:

   Logic has been added to automatically put the DCMs in auto-calibration
   mode if the clock input or clock feedback ever stops. This is recommended
   to ensure that the DCMs will maintain maximum operating frequency for the
   following Virtex-4 devices: Production Step 2 for LX/SX, and all Productions
   for FX.  The extra logic insertion can be disabled by placing the
   DCM_AUTOCALIBRATION=FALSE attribute on each applicable DCM or by setting
   the environment variable XIL_DCM_AUTOCALIBRATION_OFF.  For more information
   regarding the DCM auto-calibration mode, please consult Answer Record 21435.

WARNING:Place:644 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal
   clock IOB site. The clock IOB component <cam0_pixclk> is placed at site <H8>.
   The clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock
   buffer/GCLK if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. This is
   normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <cam0_pixclk.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
1503 block(s) removed
 441 block(s) optimized away
2611 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
