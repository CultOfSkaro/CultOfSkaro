WARNING:Place:644 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal
   clock IOB site. The clock IOB component <cam0_pixclk> is placed at site <H8>.
   The clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock
   buffer/GCLK if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. This is
   normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <cam0_pixclk.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.

INFO:

   Logic has been added to automatically put the DCMs in auto-calibration
   mode if the clock input or clock feedback ever stops. This is recommended
   to ensure that the DCMs will maintain maximum operating frequency for the
   following Virtex-4 devices: Production Step 2 for LX/SX, and all Productions
   for FX.  The extra logic insertion can be disabled by placing the
   DCM_AUTOCALIBRATION=FALSE attribute on each applicable DCM or by setting
   the environment variable XIL_DCM_AUTOCALIBRATION_OFF.  For more information
   regarding the DCM auto-calibration mode, please consult Answer Record 21435.
